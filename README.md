# Tunable-laser
In this project, I need to find the optimal parameters (r, f, p) that provide the maximum intensity for different wavelength. If I can extract these parameters, I will get the tunable laser for the temperature fiber Bragg-gratting sensors.

As for code, I read the number of files with optical spectrum and find the maximum peak with wavelength. Then, I extract the parameters corresponding to the wavelength from the name of file and build the the map. From this map, it's apparent what parameters I need to use during the time interval to get the tuning.
