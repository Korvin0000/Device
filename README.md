# Tunable-laser
In this project, I need to find the optimal parameters (r, f, p) that provide the maximum intensity for different wavelength in single-mode regime and, finally, smooth tuning. If I can extract these parameters, I will get the tunable laser on a chip with range 50 nm.

Now, I'm going to introduce my code:
